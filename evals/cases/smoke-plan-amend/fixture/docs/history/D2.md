# Accepted design D1
Keep state local to each run; no global session. A caller supplies pose and commands.
A direction lookup supports translation; turns only affect heading. Unbounded
coordinates avoid imposing a board size. Unknown commands are programmer errors.

Accepted D2: use a set for occupied coordinates; check before assigning pose.
A blocked F emits False and continues. For FRF with (0,1) occupied, finish at
(1,0,1) with [False, True, True].
